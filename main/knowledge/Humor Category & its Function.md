Humor may serve different functions: a) an emotion regulation, b) a coping strategy - the change of perspective associated with humor can facilitate in dealing with stressful situations c) a distraction technique - humor may attenuate negative emotions as a result of cognitive distraction

The eight comic styles can be differentiated as lighter or darker styles of humor and include fun, humor, nonsense, wit, irony, satire, sarcasm, and cynicism (Ruch, Heintz, et al., 2018). The four lighter styles, which relate to benign and social affect, behaviors, cognitions, and goals are: (1) fun, aimed at spreading good mood and good companionship; (2) humor, aimed at arousing the sympathy and shortcomings of fellow human, discovering discrepancies in everyday experiences and treating them humorously and benevolently; (3) nonsense, based on playing with incongruities and ridiculousness with no specific purpose; and (4) wit, referred to as the ability to create clever connections between ideas and thoughts (Ruch, Heintz, et al., 2018). The darker styles, mostly based on mockery and ridicule, are: (1) irony, reflecting a contrast or incongruity between expectations for a situation and what is reality, containing the opposite of what is meant; (2) satire, directed at criticizing and correcting shortcomings, misconduct, and moral wrongdoings with the intention of improving the world; (3) sarcasm, grounded on being critical of others and conveying contempt; and (4) cynicism, aimed at devaluing commonly recognized values.
