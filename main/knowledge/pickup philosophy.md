- Talk about It: I find that openly talking about some of the objections she may have can help. It is to ask her if she's comfortable with you. Is she looking for a long-term relationship? Does she feel uncomfortable to hook up before a relationship/marriage? What are her values?For years straight on, when I get asked if she and I are going to end up together: I simply say I don’t know and that is true. I'll tell her I like her a lot and is attracted to her, but I don't see myself in a committed relationship before sex. It's kind of like being in a relationship just for sex.When you’re upfront and honest about your desires, you’ll remove a lot of the necessary mind games. There’s no need to pressure anyone into doing something that they don’t want to do. Either that, if she asks you about you being a player or the number of girls you’ve slept with, you can simply say that that’s none of her business.
