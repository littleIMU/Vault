## Winning combination! High-resolution 3D imager and efficient VCSEL driver for smallest camera modules

Our REAL3™ image sensors (**[IRS2381C, IRS2875C, IRS2877C](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/sensor/tof-3d-image-sensors/tof-3d-image-sensors-for-consumer/#!products)**) can be combined with our extremely efficient VCSEL driver chips (IRS9100C and IRS9102C). Our VCSEL drivers have been designed specifically with the Infineon REAL3™ imager portfolio in mind. Combined they enable high-performance 3D camera systems: best form-factor and power efficiency gains while providing a fully integrated eye-safety solution. Highlights include support for single-, dual- and triple-junction VCSEL, fast switching behavior up to 250 MHz, and ultra-small TSNP-10 packages. These VCSEL drivers combine with REAL3™ imagers to offer the smallest module dimensions, ease of integration and a reduced BOM for optimized cost.
