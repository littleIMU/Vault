## 
some libraries realted to cuda failed to be found like 
"libcublas.so.10.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory" and lead to
"Ninja -8 -j 8"
## 
usually caused by the updating of cuda | gpu, in this case, you need to recompile ceresolve and do not forget to "sudo make install", then you may need to recompile cartographer (one of dependancies of cartographer is ceresolver)

<p align="center"> _figure 1. IMU interpolation layout_ </p>
Considering that there is no enough IMU and odometer data. If IMU data is available, time is decided by IMU, velocity is decided by otometer (F) or fixed frames (Sec);

```cpp
Eigen::Vector3d PoseExtrapolator::ExtrapolateTranslation(common::Time time) {
  const TimedPose& newest_timed_pose = timed_pose_queue_.back();
  const double extrapolation_delta =
      common::ToSeconds(time - newest_timed_pose.time);

  //okagv
  if(odometry_data_.size()!=0)
  {
      const double check_odometry_time =
      common::ToSeconds(time - odometry_data_.back().time);

  //cartographer
  if (odometry_data_.size() < 2) {
    return extrapolation_delta * linear_velocity_from_poses_;
  }
  return extrapolation_delta * linear_velocity_from_odometry_;
}

Eigen::Quaterniond PoseExtrapolator::ExtrapolateRotation(
    const common::Time time, ImuTracker* const imu_tracker) const {
      //LOG(INFO) << "peak start ExtrapolateRotation ";
  CHECK_GE(time, imu_tracker->time());
  AdvanceImuTracker(time, imu_tracker);
  const Eigen::Quaterniond last_orientation = imu_tracker_->orientation();
  return last_orientation.inverse() * imu_tracker->orientation();
}

## gazebo and cartographer

to apply cartographer on gazebo simulation, the "config/turtlebot3_lds_2d.lua" need to be modifies. The tracking frame is set to "base_footprint" insead of "imu_link".
