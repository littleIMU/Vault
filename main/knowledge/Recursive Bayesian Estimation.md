# Application

- [Kalman filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter), a recursive Bayesian filter for [multivariate normal distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution)
- [Particle filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_filter), a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) based technique, which models the [PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function) using a set of discrete points
- **Grid-based estimators**, which subdivide the PDF into a deterministic discrete grid. The possibility of map is denoted in log for computing effciency.
