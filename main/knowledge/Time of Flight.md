Time of Flight

There are three methods to calculated the distance:

- IToF (Indirect-Time-of-Flight) based on continuous modulated wave, the distance is obtained from the phase difference between transmitted and received wave.
- DToF (Direct-Time-of-Flight), the distance is directly calculated by the (light speed * time) formula.
- [Range Gated Imager](Range%20Gated%20Imager.md)
