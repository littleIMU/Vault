**Carbon fibers** [or](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_and_British_English_spelling_differences) **carbon fibres** (alternatively CF, graphite fiber or graphite fibre) are [fibers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber) about 5 to 10 micrometers (0.00020–0.00039 in) in diameter and composed mostly of [carbon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon) atoms.[[1]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fibers#cite_note-1) Carbon fibers have several advantages: high stiffness, high tensile strength, high strength to weight ratio, high chemical resistance, high-temperature tolerance, and low thermal expansion.[[2]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fibers#cite_note-2) These properties have made carbon fiber very popular in aerospace, civil engineering, military, motorsports, and other competition sports. However, they are relatively expensive compared to similar fibers, such as [glass fiber](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_fiber), [basalt fibers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt_fiber), or plastic fibers.[[3]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fibers#cite_note-3)

Fabric made of woven carbon filaments

To produce a carbon fiber, the carbon atoms are bonded together in crystals that are more or less aligned parallel to the fiber's long axis as the crystal alignment gives the fiber a high strength-to-volume ratio (in other words, it is strong for its size). Several thousand carbon fibers are bundled together to form a [tow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tow_(fibre)), which may be used by itself or [woven](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woven) into a fabric.

Carbon fibers are usually combined with other materials to form a [composite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material). For example, when permeated with a [plastic resin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic) and [baked](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoclave_(industrial)), it forms [carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fiber-reinforced_polymer) (often referred to as carbon fiber), which has a very high [strength-to-weight ratio](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength-to-weight_ratio) and is extremely rigid although somewhat brittle. Carbon fibers are also composited with other materials, such as [graphite](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite), to form [reinforced carbon-carbon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforced_carbon-carbon) composites, which have a very high heat tolerance.
