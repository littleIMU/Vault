what is OEM unlock => bootloader ublock
Generally speaking, OEM unlock is a feature that has been included in the Developer Options menu of the Android OS. The feature has been added to the Settings which needs to be enabled before users can choose to unlock the bootloader of their Android device. The bootloader of your Android, once unlocked, unleashes the capability of the device to be rooted, in case it has been restricted to simply one network carrier when it was initially purchased.
The primary function of a locked bootloader is to verify the signature of the software every time the mobile device boots up.

SIM unlock
SIM unlocking services such as Updato, help you switch out SIM cards and start using other network carriers.
