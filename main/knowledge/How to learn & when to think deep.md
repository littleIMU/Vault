Priority of learning ways from the highest: practice > simulation > ask&listen&read ... > connection >  origination > definition. Always stick to the main line, the other parts are left for spare time or ignored depending on how much contribution or potential they can provide.
Except for practice and simulation, the repetition number of others is very small and less than the practice and simulation. In some cases, the number is one which means you only think about it the moment you define it. In another case, the number may be relatively large for building a high-level knowledge structure.

Noted that language you learn is used for communication. Refined words is the goal in learning this language. So it is not necessary to catch the derivation of every word, to learn complex words, etc..
