[Melting Point, Freezing Point, Boiling Point](https://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/topicreview/bp/ch14/melting.php)

vapor press, atmosphere press, boiling point, surface tension, bubble, freezing point
Superheated water is liquid water under pressure at temperatures between the usual boiling point, 100 °C (212 °F) and the critical temperature;
This is distinct from the use of the term superheating to refer to water at atmospheric pressure above its normal boiling point, which has not boiled due to surface tension.
