When you feel being treated unequally and try to deal with, consider two factors:

- The balance between you and your opponent
- The validation of your reason why you have this feeling

If both of you and your opponent have little advantages over each other and you have a solid reason of the feeling, you can be determined on your standpoint. 

A solid reason is one that is concluded after consideration and listening. To determine the balance between,  a good way is to think about the backup plan, its cost and priority.

In some case, you can not have an exact judgement of the balance. It is ok, every thing is not perfect. With tryings based on different understanding of the balance, you would know better about them gradually.
