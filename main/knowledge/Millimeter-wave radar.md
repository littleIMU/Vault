Up Level: (parent:: [3D Depth Camera](3D%20Depth%20Camera.md))

RAD range-angle-doppler
Frequency and phase, f for range, phase for speed and angle.
Resolution of range is realted to be fft window, spped is related to sample, angle resolution is related to the number of antenna.

Pros and cons over lidar sensor:
Pros- Weather resistance, speed information, small volumn and cheap.
Cons- low resolution. 阵列单元尺寸必须不大于半个波长,而且阵列数越多，阵列单元的尺寸越小，能量越往主瓣集中.
