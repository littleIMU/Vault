### ‚ùìQuestion
- -[ ]   why using log likelihood function instead of likelihood function?
    -   [benefit of using log likelihood function](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/892832/why-we-consider-log-likelihood-instead-of-likelihood-in-gaussian-distribution#:~:text=Taking%20the%20log%20not%20only,sum%20of%20the%20log%20probabilities.)
    -   From [Theory](https://link/): For large samples, as a consequence of the central limit theorem, the likelihood function approaches a gaussian, whose expected value is equal to the maximum likelihood estimate
